# hello-world
A beginner learning repository for CIS129 class
I am new to coding and computers, but it is something I have wanted to learn more about so I figured school was a good place to do that
As I said, I like to play video games
I think it might be cool to work for a game developer, but also it seems like the industry is in decline
I can't say I'm excited to play new games, I just go back and play old ones, and new ones I do play are not AAA, they are just small steam games with friends
